            <p>International Credit Union Day 2024 Pins and Merchandise Now Available Online
                Worldwide Foundation for Credit Unions (WFCU) seeks to distribute 25,000 collectible pins in return for
                $500,000 in donations
                August 19, 2024

                MADISON, Wis.—Worldwide Foundation for Credit Unions (WFCU) aims to distribute 25,000 International
                Credit Union (ICU) Day® pins in return for $500,000 in donations by International Credit Union Day on
                Thursday, October 17, when the global credit union movement will celebrate “One World Through
                Cooperative Finance.”

                Donations will go toward advancing WFCU’s mission of bridging gaps in credit union digitalization,
                safety, gender inequality and leadership by growing initiatives such as Global DE, Global Women’s
                Leadership Network, Project Storm Break and World Young Credit Union Professionals (WYCUP).

                To incentivize giving and bring the global movement together to celebrate as one, WFCU launched brand
                new collectible ICU Day pins that debuted at the 2024 World Credit Union Conference (WCUC). In just four
                days, WFCU distributed over 1,400 collectible pins, which feature the new ICU Day logo and hashtag for
                2024, #ICUDay2024.

                Along with offering the pins for a donation, WFCU is also selling select ICU Day swag, thanks to a new
                partnership with ServiStar Consulting’s Umbrella Man store, that includes t-shirts, mugs and collectible
                stickers. WFCU encourages donors to show off their credit union pride on October 17 by posting to social
                media with their new ICU Day swag and collectible pins using #ICUDay2024.

                “International Credit Union Day® is about unity. It is about uniting our global credit union movement
                together," said Mike Reuter, WFCU President. "The ICU Day pins we are offering for donations are a
                symbol of unity and recognition that we are all members of the international credit union community. We
                are seeking to distribute 25,000 pins from now until ICU Day”.

                To bring awareness and togetherness to the global credit union movement, WOCCU and WFCU are asking
                credit unions to:
