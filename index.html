            <h1> <b class="BJP"> "Accused BJP worker, resign!" </b> Opposition's demand after allegations against Fadnavis: "Such incidents are unacceptable..."</h1>
            
            <p><strong>Badlapur School Case:</strong> An incident occurred at a model educational institution in Badlapur on August 13, where two minor boys from Chinchpada were reportedly victims of sexual abuse. This event has shaken the community, leading to unrest in Badlapur, and the local community held a protest to demand justice.</p>
    
            <p>In this case, the victim's parents filed a complaint, and accusations were made against the school's management. The local police took swift action, but the allegations were reportedly against a worker associated with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Upon learning about this, Uddhav Thackeray, the chief of Shiv Sena, demanded that the accused BJP worker resign from their post. He stated that such incidents are unacceptable and must be addressed seriously.</p>

If there is a public opinion against rape, there are small children who do not understand what a heinous crime has been committed against them and instead of giving protection to that girl, you file criminal cases against those who have come out on the streets to demand justice. The first thing is why did this happen? In which institution did it happen? Whose institution is this?..."</p>
