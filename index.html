            <p><strong>Badlapur School Case:</strong> An incident occurred at a model educational institution in Badlapur on August 13, where two minor boys from Chinchpada were reportedly victims of sexual abuse. This event has shaken the community, leading to unrest in Badlapur, and the local community held a protest to demand justice.</p>
    
            <p>In this case, the victim's parents filed a complaint, and accusations were made against the school's management. The local police took swift action, but the allegations were reportedly against a worker associated with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Upon learning about this, Uddhav Thackeray, the chief of Shiv Sena, demanded that the accused BJP worker resign from their post. He stated that such incidents are unacceptable and must be addressed seriously.</p>
