            <h1>"Accused BJP worker, resign!"; Opposition's demand after allegations against Fadnavis: "Such incidents are unacceptable..."</h1>
            
            <p><strong>Badlapur School Case:</strong> An incident occurred at a model educational institution in Badlapur on August 13, where two minor boys from Chinchpada were reportedly victims of sexual abuse. This event has shaken the community, leading to unrest in Badlapur, and the local community held a protest to demand justice.</p>
    
            <p>In this case, the victim's parents filed a complaint, and accusations were made against the school's management. The local police took swift action, but the allegations were reportedly against a worker associated with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Upon learning about this, Uddhav Thackeray, the chief of Shiv Sena, demanded that the accused BJP worker resign from their post. He stated that such incidents are unacceptable and must be addressed seriously.</p>
    
             <p>Home Minister Devendra Fadnavis also commented on the situation, suggesting that a resignation would be appropriate in this case. He emphasized that this matter should be thoroughly investigated and that there should be zero tolerance for such acts. Fadnavis made these remarks in a public speech while addressing the protestors.</p>
    
            <p>Following the sexual abuse allegations, the protestors in Badlapur called for a bandh (strike), demanding immediate justice. The protest gathered momentum, with opposition leaders urging Devendra Fadnavis to take stronger action. This incident has drawn significant attention, and political parties are focusing on the issue. Meanwhile, opposition leaders continue to press the Home Minister, stressing that Fadnavis should respond to the allegations more firmly. They indicated that the opposition would continue to raise this issue until appropriate action is taken.</p>
